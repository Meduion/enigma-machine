# Enigma Machine

## Description

Enigma machine is a browswer based randomized password generator. Users can specify what criteria they wish to use for their password including lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. The application will then return a password including the provided criteria at the length of password the user chooses. Completing this project helped me discover ways that user input could be captured using javascript and returned in a way where it could be utilized for further processes. It also helped me learn how to randomize with Javascript and ways data could be accessed from a returned array.

## Credits
  
I was assisted by two different people in developing this project. The first was a tutor from the AskBCS Learning Assistant named Tucker. He suggested a helpful method of turning the user input into a number. The second was my teaching assistant Daniel Ceballos. He helped make my code much cleaner by pointing out that the input criteria could be added to a single variable with the += method rather than using multiple if/else statements. I also had help from a coding post on a website for generating my random password output. Link is included below.
